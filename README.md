Overview:
The Album Financiero is a Power BI-based interactive solution designed to track, analyze, and optimize personal financial activity across a 10-year period. The project transforms a raw Excel file into a scalable and insightful dataset.

Objective:
To build a data-driven tool that:
•	Answers five key financial questions around budgeting, spending, credit card payments, savings, investments and financial sustainability.
•	Centralizes all financial history into a clean, normalized format.
•	Enables monthly and yearly tracking through a dynamic report.

Main Components:
•	Data Cleaning \& Transformation: Consolidated and standardized 10+ years of personal financial data from multiple Excel tabs.
•	Power BI Visuals: Custom visualizations for budgets, spending trends, credit payments, investment tracking, and travel costs.
•	Normalized Tables: Redesigned the data model with clean dimension tables
•	Dynamic Filtering: Users can explore data by month, location, category, or financial goal.

Key Financial Questions Answered:
•	How much money do I have in my payment methods and in my credits?
•	How much do I have budgeted in the month? How much remains to be spent?
•	What day is my final credit card payment due and how much should I pay? Have I arranged the money to pay the debt on time?
•	Where and during which trip did I spent the money? How much did I spent per clave?
•	How much money do I currently have in my savings accounts? How have my investments changed over time? How many months can I sustain my current lifestyle based on my average monthly budget and my available savings?
